# Cybersecurity Case Studies

This repository contains security case studies I developed to demonstrate real-world approaches to phishing awareness and simulated attack investigations.  

While my main focus is **cloud security engineering**, these projects highlight transferable skills in **incident response, risk management, and security awareness** that apply across modern cloud and enterprise environments.

## ðŸš€ About This Repo
These case studies are not just theory they capture measurable outcomes from practical engagements.  
They demonstrate:
- **Threat-informed defense** through adversary simulations  
- **Security awareness & culture building**  
- **Risk-based improvements** aligned with industry frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)  

Each project includes challenges, solutions, results, and recommendations framed to show how they apply in **cloud and hybrid environments**.
