# Cloud Engineering Case Studies  
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen)

This repository contains case studies demonstrating **cloud engineering practices** with a strong emphasis on **operational monitoring, compliance, and security-aware design**.  

While my main focus is **cloud engineering**, these projects highlight transferable skills in **cloud operations, incident response, risk management, and compliance** that apply across modern cloud and hybrid environments.
