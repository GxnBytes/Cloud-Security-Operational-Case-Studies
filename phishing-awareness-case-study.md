2. **Delivered cloud-focused awareness training** — concise, action-oriented sessions equipping employees to recognize and respond to phishing threats in cloud environments.

💡 *Cloud Relevance*: Training emphasized attacks on **cloud identity and access controls**, reinforcing the importance of protecting cloud accounts and sensitive data.
