# Case Study: APT34-Style Cyberattack Simulation & Risk Assessment for a Technology Firm

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involved a **simulated cyberattack investigation and full-scope risk assessment** for a mid-sized technology firm.  
The objective was to assess the client's resilience against tactics associated with **nation-state actors (APT34)** through forensic analysis, threat modeling, and risk mitigation planning, with a focus on **cloud and hybrid environments**.

---

## ðŸ›‘ The Challenge
The clientâ€™s environment revealed gaps in:
- Endpoint protection  
- Identity & access controls  
- Employee threat awareness  

They needed a **threat-informed, cloud-aware strategy** to strengthen defenses and build resilience against advanced persistent threats (APTs).

---

## ðŸ”‘ Solution
We orchestrated a **simulated APT34-style attack** to rigorously test the clientâ€™s defenses.  

Activities included:
- **Forensic log analysis** to uncover gaps in endpoint and identity security  
- **Threat modeling** mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- A tailored **risk matrix** to score and prioritize improvements  

ðŸ’¡ *Cloud Relevance*: The assessment highlighted how **identity is the new perimeter** in cloud and hybrid environments. Lessons from endpoint hardening, access control, and monitoring directly apply to **cloud workloads** (e.g., IAM policies, MFA enforcement, conditional access, logging, and alerting).

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- âš¡ Reduced total cyber risk score by **52%**  
- âœ… Achieved alignment with **NIST** and **ISO 27001** framework elements  
- ðŸ›¡ Strengthened **endpoint protection, identity & access controls, and employee response readiness**  
- ðŸ”„ Established a **repeatable simulation-based assessment process** for ongoing cloud-aware risk management  

---

## âœ… Recommendations
- Deploy **next-gen firewalls, EDR, and cloud-native security controls** to block advanced threats  
- Implement **least-privilege access policies and MFA** in cloud environments  
- Provide **quarterly role-specific security training**  
- Run **monthly phishing simulations** and **biannual red team exercises**  
- Update **risk assessments every 6 months** using threat intelligence + MITRE ATT&CK  

---

## ðŸ”’ Key Takeaway
Simulated APT-style assessments provide **actionable insights** that directly inform **cloud security hardening**, particularly around **identity, access, monitoring, and continuous risk management** in cloud and hybrid environments.
